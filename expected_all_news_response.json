He joined Brentford from Stockport Town and for two years gained a great deal of experience testing himself against older players which has helped his game develop. The 20-year-old, who is the son of former professional footballer Paul Dickov who played for the likes of Manchester City, Leicester City, Blackburn Rovers and Scotland, says it was a decision taken by himself and his family for him to gain his A-Level qualifications whilst gaining experience in non-league.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/k4Ao8MM0EgU\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch6 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWatch Max\u0026rsquo;s First Interview in full as he discusses his journey so far and his excitement at joining Brentford B\u003c/h6\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;To some people it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really appeal to them (to play in non-league) but at the time it felt like the right thing for me to do,\u0026rdquo; explained the young winger after signing with The Bees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I started playing men\u0026rsquo;s football which was amazing for me to get that experience of playing against men when you\u0026rsquo;re 16 or 17. They may look to kick you and hurt you so you have to be smart so that\u0026rsquo;s been great for me. Stockport were amazing for me and I think the they\u0026rsquo;ve put me in good stead to come here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax is no stranger to some of his teammates having spent time on trial with Brentford B last season. The youngster was able to learn about the way the side wanted to play tactically as well as understand the physical demands that are placed on the team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe continued: \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m so pleased to sign for such a great club. Hopefully this will be a great season for us all so I\u0026rsquo;m buzzing to get it under way now. Since I came in everyone has been so welcoming to me and made me feel at home which is credit to all of the staff and players. I think that will help me push on and develop even more because I\u0026rsquo;m familiar with the surroundings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;The intensity on the training pitch and on match days is there for everyone to see.

Max feels that he can take inspiration from those players who have gone to do so well having not necessarily joined from an Academy side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe explained: \u0026ldquo;I know Fin and Trev (Ryan Trevitt) really well and they\u0026rsquo;ve been amazing to me since I first came in. To see how well they\u0026rsquo;re doing, especially Fin with his promotion to the First Team, it gives you a confidence boost moving forwards because you know there is a pathway there and you can be within touching distance.

The first window of sales for these tickets, Window 1A, will allow a non-guaranteed ticket purchase for qualifying Members based on 1,000+ TAPs and the second window 1B will then open up for those with 750+ TAPs and be based on a first come first served basis. These qualifying levels will be reviewed in the November FIFA World Cup international break.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe remaining 50 per cent of the available Match Tickets for Category A games will go on sale to all Members with 40+ TAPs, with the majority of those tickets sold on a first-come first-served basis. 100 Match Tickets will be held to be sold from the Box Office rather than online for both Window 1 and Window 2 and a further 50 Match Tickets will be held for a U18 ballot. The ballot tickets for our younger Members who register for each match will be chosen at random by the Club, with 25 U18 Members chosen (to allow one parent/guardian Member ticket for each).

However, five per cent of available Match Tickets for away games will be available for Members to purchase. Members will be asked to register an interest in attending away games and will be entered into a ballot. If successful, an email will be sent inviting Members to purchase an away ticket from Window 1 of the match sales window for that specific game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Why have you removed the guaranteed ticketing windows?\u0026nbsp; \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA: We now have last year\u0026rsquo;s data from all of the ticketing windows for our first Premier League season at Brentford Community Stadium. The take-up of tickets in guaranteed windows was much lower than expected. By carefully managing TAPs requirements depending on demand and capacities, we are able to ensure that we are more efficient and consistent in the sales process and enable fewer sales windows. This in turn gives more notice and better signposting for our fans, especially for home matches where we can keep this at a consistent level and review midway through the season. This also allows the opportunity for more of our fans to buy in the same window and sit together. Finally, it also enables us to be more flexible to demand and continue to improve the process as we move through the season.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: As a Season Ticket Holder holding a high number of TAPs points, I am concerned about losing a guaranteed window for Away games.

For example, for Fulham away, the first window will essentially have one ticket per qualifying STH. We have placed 11 of our 19 matches in Category A, so those with high TAPs will still enjoy priority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegarding Category B matches and the lack of TAPs priority, all of this years\u0026rsquo; selected matches went on sale to all Members last year and whilst it\u0026rsquo;s not guaranteed, we anticipate those Season Ticket Holders who want tickets will be able to buy them. They will also have a better chance of sitting with their fellow friends and family who are also Season Ticket Holders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Why have you removed the guarantee for the first 10,000 Members to have access to at least one home match this season? \u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA: We introduced the 10,000 guarantee to ensure Members would have the opportunity to visit Brentford Community Stadium in the first Premier League season. We had very little take up for the designated matches.\u0026nbsp; Going forward we want all of our Members to be on as level a playing field as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What about cup games?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: Cup matches will be categorised as either Category A, Category B or Category F (Family).

Any remaining Match Tickets for home cup games will then be made available for purchase following the same rules as noted above for Category A and Category B home league games. Match Tickets purchase windows and priorities for any Category F cup games will be confirmed by the Club at the time.
